## Introduction

This project is a statistical data analysis of NFL football players, conducted from January 2022 to April 2022. The main goal of the project is to build a machine learning model and deploy it to provide real value to end-users who can utilize the insights gained from the analysis.

The National Football League (NFL) is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the United States and attracts millions of fans worldwide. Analyzing the statistical data of NFL players can offer valuable insights into their performance, strengths, weaknesses, and potential for improvement.

## Deployment of Model

The machine learning model is deployed to allow end-users to leverage its capabilities. It has been customized to meet the specific needs of the users. The deployment is a crucial step as it enables others to utilize the machine learning model built during the course of this project. The model is hosted on a cloud-based system like AWS, Heroku, or Streamlit to ensure real-time accessibility.

The choice of deployment platform is vital to ensure scalability, availability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS and Heroku provide powerful cloud infrastructure, while Streamlit offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for real-time model interaction.

## Preparing Data and Data Cleaning

For this analysis, the dataset was sourced from various websites like Kaggle, tailored to fulfill the specific requirements of the project. The dataset includes various player attributes, such as player statistics, positions, teams, and game performances.

Data cleaning, an essential step in any data analysis, was performed to fix and remove incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within the dataset. Combining multiple data sources can lead to duplicated or mislabeled data, which may compromise the reliability of outcomes and algorithms if not handled correctly. Cleaning the data ensures that the analysis is based on accurate and reliable information.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used in this project is built using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance effectively.

Several algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, are explored and compared to identify the most suitable model for the analysis. Hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to optimize the model's performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify patterns, trends, and correlations. Data visualization techniques, including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, are used to present the insights visually.

The EDA process helps in discovering interesting facts about players' performance, team dynamics, and the impact of various factors on game outcomes.

## Evaluation Metrics

To measure the performance of the machine learning model, various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness in predicting player performance or game outcomes.
