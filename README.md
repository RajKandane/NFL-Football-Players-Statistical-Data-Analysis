DEPLOYMENT OF MODEL :

  -- A machine learning model will provide real value when it is available to the users that it has been created for.
  
  -- There are many ways to deploy a machine learning model.
  
  -- The basic idea of deployment involves allowing an end-user to utilize your model.
  
  -- The product needs to be customized to the end userâ€™s needs since they will be the ones who will use it.
  
  -- Deployment is a crucial step because it allows others to use the machine learning model that was built.
  
  -- We can deploy our built models on the cloud based system like AWS, Heroku and Stream-lit for model to work in real time.
  
  -- We can create dataset as per our requirement in excel from scratch or we can get dataset from various websites like kaggle according to our need.
  
  -- Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
  
  --When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled.
  
  --If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct.
